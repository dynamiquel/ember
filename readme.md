## 🔥 About Ember

Ember is a dark theme born from a simple idea: code environments should be **cozy and warm**, not cold and sterile. It's built around a palette of ambers, oranges, deep reds, and earthy tones, completely avoiding blues, purples, and harsh cool colors.

The name "Ember" evokes the feeling of a glowing coal—dark, but providing a comfortable, steady warmth.

### The Philosophy: Clarity First

Many "warm" themes can feel muddy or flat, causing different parts of the syntax to blend together. The core intention of Ember is to solve this by maintaining **high clarity** and **useful color differentiation**.

* **Warm, not Washed Out:** Colors are chosen to be pleasant and warm, but are saturated and distinct enough to provide meaningful syntax highlighting.
* **Functional Contrast:** The background is dark enough for comfort, while the foreground text has purposeful contrast to remain legible for long coding sessions.
* **Purposeful Color:** Keywords, variables, functions, and strings all have distinct, logical colors, ensuring that the theme's warmth *enhances* your workflow, rather than hiding it.
